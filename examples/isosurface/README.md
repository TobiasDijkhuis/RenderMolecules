# Isosurfaces
Isosurfaces are a really nice way to visualize the electron density of your system.
RenderMolecules supports the reading of the electron density through CUBE files,
which can most likely be generated from the DFT calculation.

## Methanol
Here, I provide an example for methanol, optimized and calculated at BHLYP cc-pVTZ level.

### Reading the data
